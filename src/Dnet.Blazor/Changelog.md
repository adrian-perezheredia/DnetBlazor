# Changelog for Blazor Library

## Upcoming Changes v.4.0.0
- **Default Theme Update**: Form components will now default to the 'Plain' theme.
- **Separate NuGet Package for Material Theme**: Users wishing to use the Material theme can find it in a separate NuGet package, available from January 2024.

## Recommended Migration Path
- **Version 3.2.0 as a Transition Release**: Users are advised to use version 3.2.0 as an intermediary step when migrating from version 3.2.0 to 4+.
  - This version (3.2.0) includes both Material and Plain themes in the same package, facilitating a smoother transition to later versions where these themes are separated.
